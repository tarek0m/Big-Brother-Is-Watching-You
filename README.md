• Detect the movement in a video, then create a new one with timestamps of
the parts with moving objects using. [OpenCV]

• Find faces in a video, find smiles on these faces, and take a picture for that
frame with a timestamp. [Haarcascade]

• Detect the objects and identify the most confident results removing the
duplicates and count the objects. [MobileNet SSD]

• Export the data (movements times, number of objects) to CSV to be shown
via excel. And visualize that data via HTML file. [Bokeh]
